# Project Template

This is a template folder you can use to start building your project in perls2. Simply copy the `examples/project_template` folder over and get started!

## Custom data directory
If you want to use your own data directory for object meshes and urdfs, be sure to specify it with the absolute filepath in the config file.

Robot urdfs and meshes will always be loaded from the perls2/data directory.
If you want to change those, you should do it within a local copy of the perls2 library.
